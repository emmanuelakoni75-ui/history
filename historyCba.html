		<h2>Why I chose this topic and the bigger picture</h2>
		<p>I chose this topic because my dad is very invested in Nigerian politics and because I
was born there</p>
		<p>Nigeria is a very corrupt and lots of the countries in Africa are also
corrupt ​

But depending on the president it could be a better place</p>
